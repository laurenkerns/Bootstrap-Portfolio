                    Hello friends! My name is Lauren Kerns, and this is my first, live webpage. A little bit about me—I was born and raised in Durham North Carolina with my two sisters, mom & dad. My parents recently moved from our childhood home, out to Chatham county to “downsize”. I put downsize in quotations, because they had every intention to downsize, however they ended up in a bigger house (ha!) My older sister and her new husband also work and reside in Durham, while my younger sister is beginning her career down in Charlotte, NC.
                    <br><br>
                    I went to high school in downtown Durham at Durham School of the Arts. After high school I went to the University of South Carolina where I earned by BS in Journalism and Mass Communications. After 4 great year in Columbia, SC I moved back to the Triangle and began my first job at McClatchy. I began as a intern and quickly worked my way up to a regional account manager, where I handled large accounts such as Duke Health Systems, and the University of North Carolina.

            After 4 years at McClatchy, I decided to transition into a Digital Marketing Manger role for Trimaco. Trimaco is a job site protection manufacture headquartered here in Morrisville, NC. The company as a whole, is looking to expand their digital presence and eCommerce- which is one of the reasons why I am enrolled in this course. We want to slowly bring all digital marketing outsourcing in-house, including our website management and SEO strategy. I am confident that this course will give me the tools to really make a lasting impact at Trimaco.
